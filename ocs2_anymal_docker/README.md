# Using OCS2 Docker

These instructions do not assume that ROS or catkin exist on the 
host system. Therefore adapt the following instructions as needed
on your machine.

## Intro

Here's an outline of the steps needed for setting up a docker container for OCS2 development:  
1. Install base dependencies on the host machine (separate instructions are provided for platforms using NVIDIA GPU + CUDA).  
2. Building an image.  
3. Launching a container.  
4. Creating and using a Catkin workspace.  

There is also the option to pull pre-built images directly from our internal Docker 
hosting service [Harbor](https://registry.leggedrobotics.com/). Instructions for
using harbor are presented [below](##5.Using Harbor).  

## 1. Dependencies

The `bin/install.sh` script has been provided as easy means for installing docker. 

For CPU-only builds, simply run:
```commandline
cd /path/to/package/ocs2_anymal_docker/bin
./install.sh
```

For hosts with an NVIDIA GPU, we can build a NVIDIA+CUDA enabled container using:
```commandline
cd /path/to/package/ocs2_anymal_docker/bin
./install.sh --nvidia
```

If errors occur, please read the contents of `install.sh` and modify the script as necessary.

Once the installation finishes, reboot the computer so the docker service and groups are running.

## 2. Building an image

For building CPU-only images:
```commandline
cd /path/to/package/ocs2_anymal_docker/bin
./build.sh
```

The script defaults to CPU-only builds, but if for some reason cpu needs to be specified explicitly:
```commandline
cd /path/to/package/ocs2_anymal_docker/bin
./build.sh --platform=cpu
```

Respectively, for NVIDIA GPU platforms:
```commandline
cd /path/to/package/ocs2_anymal_docker/bin
./build.sh --platform=gpu
```

The default name of the generated image will be something like `ocs2/ocs2-anymal:20.03-gpu`. The 
tag `:20.03-gpu` indicates that this has been built for supporting release version `20.03` of the 
`anymal-research` codebase and supports NVIDIA platforms. 

The release version of `anymal-research` can be specified using the `--release=XX.YY` argument:
```commandline
./build.sh --release=20.03
```

The **name and tag** of the image can be specified explicitly using the `--image=<MY_CUSTOM_NAME>`:
```commandline
./build.sh --image=ocs2/ocs2-custom-dev:latest
```

Once a build starts, it would be a good time to get a coffee, it's gonna take a while.

## 3. Launching a container.

The `run.sh` script has been provided to launch an OCS2 container. This script uses arguments identical 
to the `build.sh` script. So if we just built GPU image, we can launch a container from this image using:
```commandline
./run.sh --platform=gpu
```

You'll know it's working if you see this output:
```commandline
user@host:~/git/ocs2_anymal/ocs2_anymal_docker/bin$ ./run.sh --platform=gpu

| |  | | |     \___ \  / /       | )  _ \ \
| |__| | |____ ____) |/ /_      / /    w w

 OCS2: Optimal Control for Switched Systems

[OCS2-Docker::Entrypoint] Launching shell as user 'user'
user@host:~$
```

**IMPRTANT** to keep in mind:  
* The current docker image has been built to launch containers which login to the host user.  
* All logins configure the environment by sourcing the copy of `src/bashrc` in the container.  
* The host user's home directory is mounted in the container. This allows us to maintain the 
catkin workspaces in our home directories, and store all persistent data locally.  
* Any changes made to the containers file system (except for the mounted home directory) are not
persistent and will be lost after exiting the container.  

## 4. Creating and using a Catkin workspace

Now that the container is launched, you can create/setup a catkin workspace within which you can build 
packages using the environment and dependencies provided by the image.

## 5. Using Harbor

First, login credentials are needed in order to access the registry. These can be acquired
by contacting Tom ([tom.lankhorst@mavt.ethz.ch](tom.lankhorst@mavt.ethz.ch)). Once you have
a `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`, you can use the docker front-end to perform the login from terminal:
```commandline
docker login --username USERNAME registry.leggedrobotics.com
```

Once access has been set up, it is possible to pull from the registry using:
```commandline
docker pull registry.leggedrobotics.com/IMAGE
```

Where `IMAGE` is the name of the target image to be pulled. The name must exist in the 
registry otherwise the command will fail.

Example:
```commandline
docker pull registry.leggedrobotics.com/ocs2/ocs2-anymal:21.03-gpu
```
